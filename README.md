## Plan on improving the project

If there are even more than two videos, learning to add a scrollbar with all of the videos on one page would be a nice skill to learn. Not only does it keep all of the videos on one page, it can group videos together depending on how the videos connect with one another. In this case, if along the line the code here is recycled for another project, a good way to show that the new webpage is not just a repeat of the previous one is by using the lessons of the last webpage with a couple of new additions. In this project, we reinforced the knowledge of structuring the page in a visually pleasing way while also learning how to embed videos. To take that lesson a step further, incorporating the scrollbar would be a nice way to show we can build on things we have been taught in the past.

Another aspect of the project I would like to explore is the css animations. There is so many ways to explore this avenue. A fun idea to add onto this project and the ones moving forward is creating an animation for the header page. The style of the header images with the coffeeshop are already very animated as is. Imagine if the the arms of the cybernetic baristic can move around and grab cups to shake up their drink mixes. MAybe the train moves around in a circle as the people working work. Perhaps the worker decides to grab a bite instead, putting a loop of them taking a bite with a delay in between (maybe 15s or more) makes the page a little more silly and lighthearted. No required considering how silly the pages can get sometimes, but still an idea I want to try. Maybe blend in the border of the embedded videos with a color that matches the rest of the background.
